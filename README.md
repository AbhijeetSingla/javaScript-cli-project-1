# About

This quiz's questions are about me, indicating how much do you know me. It was made as a project in [neogcamp lesson-1](https://neog.camp/guide/lesson-one)

The quiz was made using a service called [repl.it](https://repl.it).

This service allows to run a CLI without much configuration, as it automatically installs the packages and has a smart IDE.

# Code

The code has 3 arrays of objects which define the **question bank**, including the 3 keys for each question, naming - question, answer and marks.

A function is defined (askQuestions) which loops and asks all the questions in a question bank. 

This quiz has 3 different question banks, which vary in terms of difficulty, which are presented to the user based on their score. There is also a "showAnger" function, which prints two different messages depending upon which question bank is being presented to the user, just because :P
